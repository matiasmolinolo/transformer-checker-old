# Transformer Checker

This project is a tool to visualize and check neural activations and attention patterns in transformer models that classify context-free languages.

## Generating Data
We provide a tool to generate data for training the transformer model. The tool is located in the `dyck-k-generation` directory. To use the tool, run the following command:
